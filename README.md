# Relationship between USG% MIN% and Versatility Index in Basketball

## Motivation
I always loved basketball and for this project wanted to find some statistical categories that are overlooked and tried to find a relationship between them that might help take a different look at ways you can track overall efficiency in the sport as well as look for statistical outliers that might be performing above average for their overall worth and usage. Which could shed some much needed light on overrated and underrated/overlooked players
## Source 
I got my data from NBA stuffer https://www.nbastuffer.com/2018-2019-nba-player-stats/, it has a fairly straightforward database with different spread sheets that are updated regularly, and the capability to load the data right into an excel spreadsheet, which made it easy to organize the data and clean it. I decided to use the 2018-2019 dataset from this site because of the anomalies in the recent season.
## Processing
The data I used did not require much processing because the uploadable excel sheet is already very organized on their website. However for formatting for python it made sense to abbreviate columns and chamge column names for ease of access, for example changing "Field Goal Percentage" to "FG%", helped a lot when writing the code into python and being able to see column names fully in the data frame and in excel.
