## Motivation
I always loved basketball and for this project wanted to find some statistical categories that are overlooked and tried to find a relationship between them that might help take a different look at ways you can track overall efficiency in the sport as well as look for statistical outliers that might be performing above average for their overall worth and usage. Which could shed some much needed light on overrated and underrated/overlooked players
